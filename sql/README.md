# Introduction

This project focuses on developing and applying both fundamental and advanced SQL skills through practical exercises and data modeling tasks. The primary objective was to design and interact with a relational database schema, define data relationships using DDL (Data Definition Language), and perform CRUD operations, joins, aggregations, and subqueries to gain hands-on experience with PostgreSQL.

I worked extensively on writing SQL queries to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from the club membership database (clubdata.sql). I also studied the basics of data modeling and data normalization to ensure efficient and well-structured database design. Additionally, I installed and configured DBeaver on Rocky Linux, connected it to a PostgreSQL instance running in a Docker container, and used it to manage and query the database efficiently.

Through this project, I gained practical experience in setting up a database environment, designing normalized schemas, performing analytical queries, and simulating real-world database workflows—from schema design and data loading to complex querying—strengthening both my database design understanding and SQL proficiency.
