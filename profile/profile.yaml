    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: I developed eVision, an Android application designed to assist visually impaired individuals. The app was built using Java and Android SDK, integrating machine learning techniques to enhance accessibility and usability. It includes features such as object detection to identify surroundings, route navigation for safe travel, transportation suggestions based on distance and route, image-to-text conversion for reading printed materials, and a help mechanism to quickly connect users with assistance when needed. This project allowed me to apply my technical skills to create a meaningful solution that improves the independence and quality of life of visually impaired use.
  - name: "CentraLog"
    git_url: "https://github.com/smit-1602/CentraLog"
    description: I developed a software application designed to centralize log management by collecting logs from multiple software systems into a single platform, simplifying debugging and monitoring for developers. The system enables efficient log aggregation, search, and analysis, helping developers quickly identify and resolve issues. Built using C#, .NET, and TypeScript, the project follows a modular architecture with dedicated services for authentication, database management, and Kafka-based message consumption. The solution improves development workflow and system observability by providing an integrated, user-friendly interface for log handling..
