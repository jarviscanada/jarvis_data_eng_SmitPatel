The app was built using Java and Android SDK, integrating machine learning techniques to enhance accessibility and usability. It includes features such as object detection to identify surroundings, route navigation for safe travel, transportation suggestions based on distance and route, image-to-text conversion for reading printed materials, and a help mechanism to quickly connect users with assistance when needed. This project allowed me to apply my technical skills to create a meaningful solution that improves the independence and quality of life of visually impaired use.",
