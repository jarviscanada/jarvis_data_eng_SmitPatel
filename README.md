## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SmitPatel](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SmitPatel)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SmitPatel/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Built a lightweight monitoring agent for a Linux system to collect hardware specifications and real-time usage metrics. Designed Bash scripts to gather CPU, memory, and disk statistics and store them in a PostgreSQL database running inside Docker. Automated periodic data collection using cron and created SQL queries to analyze system performance over time.

**SQL** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SmitPatel/tree/master/sql)]: Designed and interacted with a relational database schema to strengthen SQL skills through hands-on exercises and data modeling. Installed and configured PostgreSQL in a Docker container and connected it to DBeaver on Rocky Linux to manage and query a club membership database. Practiced writing SQL for schema design, data insertion, updates, deletions, joins, filtering, grouping, subqueries, window functions, and CTEs.


## Highlighted Projects
**eVision** [[GitHub](https://github.com/smit-1602/eVision)]: I developed eVision, an Android application designed to assist visually impaired individuals. The app was built using Java and Android SDK, integrating machine learning techniques to enhance accessibility and usability. It includes features such as object detection to identify surroundings, route navigation for safe travel, transportation suggestions based on distance and route, image-to-text conversion for reading printed materials, and a help mechanism to quickly connect users with assistance when needed. This project allowed me to apply my technical skills to create a meaningful solution that improves the independence and quality of life of visually impaired use.

**CentraLog** [[GitHub](https://github.com/smit-1602/CentraLog)]: I developed a software application designed to centralize log management by collecting logs from multiple software systems into a single platform, simplifying debugging and monitoring for developers. The system enables efficient log aggregation, search, and analysis, helping developers quickly identify and resolve issues. Built using C#, .NET, and TypeScript, the project follows a modular architecture with dedicated services for authentication, database management, and Kafka-based message consumption. The solution improves development workflow and system observability by providing an integrated, user-friendly interface for log handling..


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2025-present)**: As a Software Developer at Jarvis, I worked on multiple hands-on projects that strengthened my full-stack development and DevOps skills. I built a Cluster Monitor project that included developing a lightweight monitoring agent for Linux systems to collect and analyze real-time hardware metrics such as CPU, memory, and disk usage. I used Bash scripting for data collection, PostgreSQL for storage, Docker for containerization, and cron for automation. Additionally, I designed and interacted with relational database schemas in the SQL project, practicing advanced SQL concepts such as joins, aggregations, subqueries, and window functions. These projects helped me gain practical experience with system monitoring, database management, and Linux-based automation while following software engineering best practices.

**Software Developer Intern, SOTI Inc (2024)**: During my internship at SOTI Inc. as a Software Developer, I worked on the Simulators project built using C# and ASP.NET, where the goal was to develop an Android Device Simulator for BDD testing and performance benchmarking of the company’s products. I contributed to designing and implementing the data layer using Entity Framework and .NET while integrating RESTful services to enable seamless communication between application components. Working in an Agile Scrum environment, I actively participated in sprint planning and consistently delivered accepted functionalities in each iteration. Additionally, I developed and consumed RESTful Web APIs to support a service-oriented architecture, enhancing the scalability and performance of the system.

**Full Stack Developer, EFSouls (2022)**: During my time at EFSOULS as a Full Stack Developer, I designed and developed a hybrid single-page application using C#, .NET Framework, ASP.NET MVC, and Angular. My work involved consuming RESTful APIs from other applications within the product portfolio to ensure smooth system integration. I actively participated in UI design using master pages in MVC and enhanced the layout with HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS for a responsive and user-friendly interface. Using Angular, I developed templates, controllers, and directives to create dynamic front-end components. Throughout the project, I collaborated in an Agile development environment, taking part in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and iterative delivery of high-quality features.

**Data Analyst Intern, Tata Consultancy Services Limited (2020)**: During my internship at Tata Consultancy Services Limited as a Data Analyst, I worked with the ELK stack to analyze data from various companies. I utilized Logstash to ingest data from multiple sources and leveraged Kibana to build interactive dashboards and visualizations, providing analytical insights through Elasticsearch clusters. Additionally, I conducted market research and competitive analysis using online data sources, enabling clients to identify key market trends and business opportunities.
